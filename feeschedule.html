        <h3>Fee Schedule</h3>
        <p>The initial wellness interview will cost $150 for up to a 1½ hour visit.  For new clients only your first Naturopathic House Call comes with a complimentary optional short follow up visit, either by phone or at your house, within three months.  If you are acutely ill and just want to address your current illness (such as flu), the above holistic approach can be postponed for when you are feeling more comfortable.  On subsequent visits the cost will depend on complexity and length of appointment.  For example, a normal 1-hour follow-up with an established patient will cost $100; while a quick ½ hour single condition check-in visit will cost $75.  Special treatments and assessments may require an additional fee.  Appointments that take significantly longer than scheduled will likely be charged more.  Minor surgery and physical medicine procedures will be charged a fee based upon the extent of treatment given. </p>
        <p>Dr. Curry is currently offering House Calls within the Greater Portland area including nearby Lake Oswego, West Linn, Oregon City, Gladstone, Hillsdale, Gresham, Estacada, Hillsboro, Beaverton and others.  Please call her with questions regarding service areas.  Appointments outside the reasonable service area are subject to higher rates to be negotiated on a case by case basis.  </p>
        <p>Payment is expected in full at the time supplements or other products are purchased.  Appointments by phone must be paid at the time of the visit. You will be asked for your credit/debit card number prior to the visit and will be charged for the visit as well as any supplements and shipping costs at that time.  Payment by check, money order, MasterCard or Visa is due at the end of your Naturopathic House Call. <strong>Payment is available online by using our &quot;Online Payments&quot; form at left on this page</strong>.</p>
        <p>Dr. Curry may choose to bill a third party on a case-by-case basis. If you want to discuss full or partial fair trade for services or goods, or feel you qualify for sliding scale, please arrange this prior to your visit.  There will be a $30 fee for every returned check.  Dr. Curry offers a very limited number of charity house calls monthly to poverty-level quadriplegics and developmentally disabled individuals on a case by case basis.  Please inquire if you think you or a loved one may qualify.</p>
        <p>In order to keep overhead low and thus enable Dr. Curry to offer affordable rates for appointments, <strong><em>Passion for Healing Naturopathic</em> does <u>Not</u> currently accept insurance</strong>.  Full payment by cash, check or Mastercard/Visa is due at the end of each appointment.  </p>
        <p>Upon request Dr. Curry can create for you a &quot;superbill&quot; that you can submit yourself to your insurance.  This invoice will include medical billing codes and descriptions of rendered services your insurance may be willing to reimburse you for.  In Dr. Curry's experience patients are far more likely to receive full reimbursement from insurance companies for Naturopathic care than she is, even if she hires a relatively costly medical billing specialist.  As these inequities in insurance reimbursement for fields still considered &quot;CAM&quot; (complimentary alternative medicine) are overcome, Dr. Curry will periodically reconsider accepting insurance directly. </p>
        <p>Please look again for future updates on this policy.</p>
