        <h3>Naturopathic Consultation</h3>
        boooooogger
        <p><strong>What should I expect at the first visit?</strong><br />
        When you call Dr. Curry of <em>Passion for Healing Naturopathic</em> for a Naturopathic House Call expect to talk a few minutes with Dr. Curry about your health needs.  While not required, a quick description and history of your current condition will allow Dr. Curry to begin to formulate a rudimentary plan, including which lab kits or supplements may be appropriate to bring to the first visit.  Diagnosis however will only be made after a more thorough intake and evaluation.</p>
<p>After you schedule your first appointment, you will be asked to fill out a <a href="pdf/Passion_for_Healing_New_Patient_Intake_Form.pdf" title="New Patient Intake Form" target="_blank">new patient intake form</a>. This form is a detailed questionnaire designed to help you communicate your medical history, family risk factors, current and other health complaints, allergies, prescription/supplements list, and more, enabling Dr. Curry rapid understanding of your personal health needs.  Ultimately it will help her serve you and make your Naturopathic House Call more productive. You can <a href="pdf/Passion_for_Healing_New_Patient_Intake_Form.pdf" title="New Patient Intake Form" target="_blank">download and print</a> one from this website.  Please have it filled out and ready for review during your first visit.  You may also want to prepare your own list of any additional questions or concerns that you have for Dr. Curry.</p>
        <p><strong>The first House Call</strong> involves an extensive wellness interview in which your entire individual health situation will be discussed, including your current complaint, chronic complaints, past medical history, diet, lifestyle, social environment, familial medical history, psychological health and risk factors for preventable diseases.  After really listening to your story, Dr. Curry will ask questions intended to clarify any gaps in her understanding of your case and completed questionnaire. This very complete intake will provide Dr. Curry with a holistic picture of your entire health status so as to best develop a well rounded, customized strategy to improve your overall wellness and quality of life.  In addition to this thorough intake, as part of the evaluation, physical examinations, diagnostic imaging and lab testing might be utilized. Bodywork or energywork may be performed.  This first visit may take approximately 1-1 Â½ hours.  If your condition is straight forward, a treatment plan will be developed and presented.  In some cases Dr. Curry may need to do outside research for your case and will present treatment in your follow-up visit. </p>
        <p>One of the great advantages of a Naturopathic House Call is the opportunity for Dr. Curry to look at how you live directly.  Are you storing your supplements too close to stovetops or heaters causing degradation and reduced function?  Have you stopped even noticing the mold that may be contributing to your sinus congestion?  Is your pantry filled with calorie dense, nutritionally deficient boxed foods whose main ingredients are corn (including high fructose corn syrup) and bleached flour?  Have you obsessed with cleaning to the point your house smells like lilies and formaldehyde and your skin just won't tolerate anymore toxins?  Is your living environment constantly bombarded with loud emotional dramas or noise pollution you really don't need?  So many things that don't get written down on an intake form become simply apparent by a quick glance into how a patient lives.  Feel free to let Dr. Curry know what you are comfortable with.  She doesn't have to look in every room; you may already know well where your problems lie.</p>
        <p>This first visit is also a time for you to decide if this approach to health care is right for you. Communication between you and the practitioner is needed when working to change your health. Understanding that this is a process that may take time and effort is essential when choosing Naturopathic care. </p>
        <p>For new clients only your first Naturopathic House Call comes with a <strong>complimentary optional short follow up visit</strong>, either by phone or at your house, within three months.  Dr. Curry will use this follow-up to check on compliance and effectiveness of treatment, review lab tests or imaging, continue patient education and address any unexpected concerns you may still have.  Dr. Curry may also present the results of further research on your condition, offering potentially more options for health optimization.</p>
        <p>If you are acutely ill and just want to address your current illness (such as flu), the above holistic approach can be postponed for when you are feeling more comfortable. </p>
        <p><strong>Additional Follow-up House Calls</strong> will be scheduled such that you have the time to understand and accomplish the directives laid out in your individualized treatment plan.   Some natural healing methods take time to build to full effectiveness.  Additional questioning may be necessary to further elucidate the underlying problem.   Accountability may require new directions in care.  Because every individual has different circumstances, we offer you a wide range of approaches for getting well.  Dr. Curry will assess treatment efficacy at the next visit and may make additions or changes as appropriate to develop a plan that really works for you. </p>
        <p>For many patients it likely took years to develop unwellness and it may take years to regain lost health and vitality.  Dr. Curry is dedicated to guiding you to better health with patience and enthusiasm. Most patients start feeling better after only one visit, and feel progressively, significantly better with time.</p>
        <p>Dr. Curry sincerely looks forward to meeting you and fulfilling your health care needs and goals. Please do not hesitate to call with any questions you may have regarding Naturopathic House Calls. Congratulations on deciding to improve your health naturally!</p>
