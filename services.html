        <h3>Naturopathic Services</h3>
        <strong>What types of conditions does Dr. Curry treat?</strong>
        <img src="images/IMG_6676.jpg" style="float: right; width: 160px; border: 7px solid #F2F1E5; border-radius: 5px; margin-left: 10px">
        <p>Naturopaths are qualified to prevent and diagnose, treat, and cure all disease, whether acute or chronic. As a licensed primary care physician, Dr. Curry can help you find what you need to address virtually every aspect of family medicine. Dr. Curry also offers preventative medicine for patients without illness hoping to improve their overall health for vital longevity.  Dr. Curry will also work with you to identify and address mental/emotional/spiritual stressors that may be contributing to your disease states.  Anyone who has ever been under stress with family issues, work, or medical conditions knows stress can affect the body causing symptoms from digestive problems, heart palpitations, high blood pressure, to headaches and even fatigue. Temporary treatments such as pain relievers or antacids work by masking the symptoms, not by curing the cause.  Dr. Curry understands that everyone has their own healing process and meets patients where they are in their personal healing journey.  Dr. Curry strives to involve patients in their own care by creating holistic treatment plans to not only address  specific illness, while decreasing stress, anxiety, depression, inflammation, but also increase energy levels, sleep quality, memory, concentration and overall quality of life.</p>
        
        <img src="images/IMG_6678.jpg" style="float: left; width: 160px; border: 7px solid #F2F1E5; border-radius: 5px; margin-right: 10px"><p>Dr. Curry believes that the body has an amazing ability to self-heal yet sometimes needs a little support and direction. Dr. Curry has particular interest in a variety of methods of wellness including herbal medicine, diet/nutrition, food as medicine, supplementation therapy, lifestyle counseling, hydrotherapy, food/environmental allergy testing via blood or saliva testing, allergy treatment, minor surgery, massage, energy-work, low-impact naturopathic manipulation, exercise therapeutics, pharmaceuticals and general medicine.  Some examples of conditions treated include digestive complaints, allergies, stress, anxiety, agoraphobia, autoimmune disorders (arthritis), endocrine disorders (diabetes, hypo/er-thyroid), weight concerns, headaches, skin problems, depression, colds and flu, hypertension, fatigue, PMS and menopause, and cancer. Dr. Curry also performs women's annual exams, Pap smears, men's sensitive exams and blood draws.  Dr. Curry will perform physical examinations, as well as order and interpret lab tests as needed to diagnose and treat disease. Dr. Curry also cooperates with all other branches of medical science, referring patients to other practitioners for treatment or diagnosis when appropriate.  Dr. Curry wants to find the root cause of your concern, then support your body's inherent ability to heal so that you can experience optimal health. True health is more than the absence of disease; it is the balance of the mind, body, spirit, wellness, and vitality.</p>

                <p>Naturopathic Doctors are general primary care family doctors that diagnose and treat most health problems, naturally.  NDs treat patients from the preventive stage through to serious, chronic and debilitating disease. Therefore, people can go to NDs for colds, bronchitis, allergies, as well as for heart disease, diabetes, and malignant diseases.  Here is a brief discussion of the three types of Naturopathic care- preventative, acute and chronic.</p>
