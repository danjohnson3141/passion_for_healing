        <h3>Helpful Resources</h3>
        <p>        With the internet, excellent public and private libraries, and giant bookstores such as Powell's Books, there's a whole lot of information out there.  Punch in even straightforward medical or nature cure topics and search engines like Google will provide you with links to the most diverse places.  Looking up a topic such as healthy oils can leave you feeling like you're digging for lost pearls in the city dump.  So much of the information out there conflicts or is written by people trying to sell something, or those lacking core understanding.  For this reason Dr. Curry has compiled, by category, information on health topics that she has found insightful and appropriate for patients.  Even here, Dr. Curry doesn't always agree with every detail of every resource and their links.  Dr. Curry instead offers these as food for thought.  As always each individual must see their very own world through their own collections of experiences, from early family influences, cultural views, formal and other education, life experience, and the light captured in his/her own eyes.  On that note, Dr. Curry welcomes you to wander through her mini library.  Come back anytime; stay as long or short as you wish, and be well!</p>

          <em>In Defense of Food: an eater's manifesto by Michael Pollan.</em> 2008.     Available in print and audiobook at the library.   New York, N.Y.: Penguin Audio<br />
        &quot;Eat food. Not too much. Mostly plants.&quot; These simple words go to the heart of food journalist Pollan's thesis. Humans used to know how to eat well, he argues, but the balanced dietary lessons that were once passed down through generations have been confused and distorted by food industry marketers, nutritional scientists, and journalists. As a result, we face today a complex culinary landscape dense with bad advice and foods that are not &quot;real.&quot; Indeed, plain old eating is being replaced by an obsession with nutrition that is, paradoxically, ruining our health, not to mention our meals. Pollan's advice is: &quot;Don't eat anything that your great-great grandmother would not recognize as food.&quot; Looking at what science does and does not know about diet and health, he proposes a new way to think about what to eat, informed by ecology and tradition rather than by the nutrient-by-nutrient approach.--From publisher description.</p>

                <p><strong>The Healthy River: A Wellness Analogy</strong>
                </p>
                <p>Our bodies can be likened to a river, moving from beginning to end through all of life’s landscapes. At the beginning the river is all fast growing potential flowing effortlessly down pristine mountains.  Life abounds in these waters and shores.  Complex cycles involving fish, insects, birds, sunlight, algae, plants, and microscopic bacteria assure anything that enters the river is made good use of.  Wastes don't accumulate, these water are largely self-cleaning.  You can float a long ways sometimes before any problems surface.  Many people are able to float though their childhood and early adulthood without apparent major health concerns.  This is possible because our bodies' young vital force tends to be strong and returns quickly to health with even moderate challenges to wellness.  This is the optimal health baseline.  Everything works as needed.  As a naturopath, my ultimate goal is to help you maintain or even improve that optimal healthy core.  Like a river our bodies are full of lively moving organ systems.  The beating heart, bellowing lungs, rushing arteries and veins, chemical and electrical nerve conduction, the digestive system, the beneficial bacteria therein, and many others all work together without our conscious thought to maintain homeostasis (proper functioning).  In an ideal world your best health would continue, just as a wild river, say in Alaska, never loses its health until that moment it returns to the ocean.  Really, I would love to be there only when you need some advice on optimizing nutrition or want to talk out an emotional dilemma.</p>
                  <p>Unfortunately for many of us modern life is not ideal.  As a river may pass through  muddy clear cut forest, sloppy chemical factory,  open sewers, livestock processing plant, petroleum based fertilizer/insecticide laden farmland, etc.,  our own bodies are assaulted by the unnatural pressures of modern living.  A river may at first be able to compensate for a certain amount of toxic contamination, but with added burden the healthy ecosystem begins to fail.  This is no longer drinking water, and it's probably best to release any caught fish.  At some point the pollutants are too much for the river to flush away.  The fish die, the bad types of bacteria take over, and the children are told not to soak even tired feet, let alone swim.  In human terms, modern life has exposed most of us to air pollution, household or industrial chemicals, largely untested food preservatives, additives and genetically modified crops, nutritionally lacking yet calorie and bad-fat dense sweets/ junk food, unstudied mixtures of pharmaceutical and OTCdrugs, work and social stresses, lack of exercise (stagnation), recreational drugs, alcohol and tobacco, not to mention all the other lions and tigers and bears and auto accidents found in the modern jungle.   Usually many of these and other factors combine to bring a person to a state of unwellness.  It is the vital force's cry for help. </p>
                  <p>Your body inherently wants to heal itself and function well. When your health is less than optimal, it is important to take a reckoning of the sources of pollution, be they physical, emotional, or spiritual in your life and basically try to fix some or all, to lessen the burden. For a simple example, your diet may need major modification if you have been eating the Standard American Diet (SAD diet) and now find yourself developing uncontrolled diabetes.  Another person may need vitamin and mineral supplementation to reverse deficiency states that prevent the body from fully efficient self-healing.  Herbal supplements may strengthen the immune system so it can focus where needed.  Just as installing a new sewer system in Portland promises to greatly reduce sewage pollution in nearby Willamette River, every step towards living healthier counts in the long run.  Fortunately we are all strong and smart enough to respond to imbalances, to restore health using these least harmful, yet effective Naturopathic treatments first, and in conjunction with continuing medical care.    Naturopathic Doctors have training in a plethora of ways to help your mind-body be its best.  As much as you let me, I will help guide you through your health related issues, whether that means optimizing your already great health, or addressing a particular disease state. I will listen to your needs to provide you with a custom plan in which you get to chose how far you will go towards optimizing your own health. By working as a team I am positive that we can get you back to feeling the best you can, preferably better than you ever have in your entire life. Call to schedule your home visit appointment today.  Your waters should flow deep, pure and lively until reaching that final destination.</p>
